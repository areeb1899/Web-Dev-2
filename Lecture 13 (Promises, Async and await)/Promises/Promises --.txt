Promises --

Promises are the object.

They represent eventual completion of some event.

Promises go in the Microtask Queue and setTimeout goes to callback Queue. Call Stack gives the priority to Microtask Queue. 

Promise has three stages---
1. Pending
2. Resolved(fulfilled)    then()
3. Rejected              .catch()

There is one more function which is .finally(). It runs on both the cases whether the case is rejected or resolved. 


fetch() --

fetch() basically returns a promise.

HTTP response status codes --

Redirection messages (300 – 399)
Client error responses (400 – 499)
Server error responses (500 – 599)



Async await --
